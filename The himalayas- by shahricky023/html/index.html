  Uttarakhand, a state in northern India crossed by the Himalayas, is known for its Hindu pilgrimage sites. Rishikesh, a major centre for yoga study, was made famous by the Beatles’ 1968 visit. The city hosts the evening Ganga Aarti, a spiritual gathering on the sacred Ganges River. The state's forested Jim Corbett National Park shelters Bengal tigers and other native wildlife. ― Google

        Historically, Gwaldam is a part of Garhwal hills and situated at the borderline between Garhwal and Kumaon. A number of battles were fought here in past. It being on a strategic point it remained an apple of discord between the Garhwal and Kumaon kings. Gwaldam is situated at the saddle of Gwaldam-Shisakhani ridge and Gwaldam-Badhangarhi ridge. Border could be crossed through Gwaldam only. South of these ridges is Kumaon and north is Garhwal. Later Katyuri kings, who hailed from Joshimath, and had sympathy for King of Garhwal because of lineage. King of Badhangarhi was under king of Garhwal and had not in good term with King of Kumaon but had good relation with Katyuri king because of neighborhoods. All these led to a situation between Kumaon and Garhwal kings. In order to browbeat king of Badhangarhi in last decade of 16th century, Chand king sent Parkhu, a great warrior to fight with king of Badhangarhi. Unfortunately, line of supply was cut short by the Katyuri king and Parkhu was beheaded at Binayakdhar, perhaps nearby crossroad at Gwaldam. King of Garhwal rewarded the soldier who brought the head to Shrinagar. This infuriated the Chand King, Rudra Chand and he personally led the troops and captured the Katyuri king and later killed the Katyuri king Sukhal Deo and exiled his family. Atkinson, in his work, "The Himalayan Gazetteer", narrated these episodes.[citation needed]

Because of strategic importance a base camp of ITBP was established in 1960s and SSB training center was established in 1970s which was meant for some secret military operation.[citation needed] Locally, then it was known as secret service bureau. SSB imparted guerilla warfare training. In Uttarakhand a number of SSB guerilla trained persons are still ready to serve for any cause.[citation needed] At present a small unit of SSB is present at Gwaldam that runs occasional training courses.[citation needed] Major activities are shifted some elsewhere. Training grounds, sports fields, stadium, helipads and other infra-structure facility are still here. Local people expect that this large chunk of land, about 10 square kilometer could be used as adventure sports university or other activity.[citation needed]

A hydro-electric power project of 252 MW is under construction. Head of this project is at Nandkesari on the river Pindar, a tributary of the holy river Ganga.

The women-centric Maiti movement, which involves a unique ritual of planting a sapling by a newly-wedded couple, was initiated in Gwaldam by environmentalist Kalyan Singh Rawat in 1994. It is a program intended to develop eco-awareness among the people.[citation needed]

Central School, Government Inter College, Girls Junior high School, Vidya-Mandir, Shishu-Mandir and other study, coaching centers are here. Krishi-Vigyan Kendra, Animal Husbandry, Veterinary Center, Fruit Processing Center, Forest Rest House, GMVN Tourist Rest House, State Bank, Chamoli District Cooperative bank branch, are also available here. For basic health care a government allopathic hospital is also available here. Presently under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, schemes like strengthening of Angora breeding farm and pilot project for establishment of Barbara goat are sanctioned.[citation needed]

Government Degree College Talwari is situated at a distance of 11 km (6.8 mi) from here. Previously it was a private degree college founded by a freedom fighter, politician, educationist and member of legislative assembly in erstwhile Uttar Pradesh, Sher Singh Danu. A State Bank of India ATM is located in the main market. The nearest railway station is at KATHGODAM, 180 km (110 mi). away from here and nearest airport is at Gauchar at 78 km (48 mi). distance from here.
